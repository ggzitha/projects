These are the files for the muBox project
http://meoworkshop.org/projects/mubox



Arduino code is stored in "muBox_programs"


Eagle files are stored in "muBox_eagle_files"

Note that the names for the eagle files are not "muBox" instead, it is "collatz_box."
This is what I called the project before I thought of muBox.

You will need the Sparkfun Eagle library in order to view the schematic and board properly. 
If you don't have the library, you will most likely get an error message.
